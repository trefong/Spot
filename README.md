Connecting college students who are in desperate need of parking!

I don't know about you but when I was in college, parking was a nightmare. People would end up sitting in their cars waiting for someone to come by the lot and offer to give them a ride to their car in exchange for their parking spot. Of course, this could take anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour, making people late for class. This is what gave me the idea to begin building this app!

I decided to use Swift and Xcode as they are prime tools for building for IOS, and many college students use IOS as well as mostly on mobile devices. However, I had never used Swift before so everything you see is what I have learned on my own through readings, tutuorials, and videos. I have also integrated the GoogleMaps API as well as FireBase so that the users can communicate in real time, both of which I had never used before this.

If you have any suggestions/comments that could help me, I'm definitely open to hearing them!
